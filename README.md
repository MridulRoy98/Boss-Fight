# Description

This is a game I created in Unity where I learned to use Unity's built-in character controller component. The enemy AI is created using Behaviour state machines and Navmesh. I have also used animation events to add anticipation to the enemy's attacks, making it a challenging opponent for the player. I also used animation events to have the player take damage at a certain point of the animation.
In addition to combat, the game also features various other game elements such as ragdolls, animation events, SFX, VFX, and UI. The game uses Unity's built-in render pipeline for visuals and post-processing, resulting in a stunning and immersive gaming experience.

# Gameplay

The player must complete each level by reaching the end while fighting off enemies. The game features a variety of combat mechanics such as basic attacks, blocking, dodging, and special moves. The enemies have their own unique AI, making each encounter challenging and exciting.

# Controls

The game is played using a keyboard and mouse. The player can move using the WASD keys and attack using the left mouse button. Dodging can be performed using the space bar. The game also allows the player to change direction mid-dodge for more control.

# Installation

To play the game, you will need to download the source code from the Github repository and open it in the Unity editor. Here's how:

1.) Go to the Github repository where the game is hosted.

2.) Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".

3.) Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a local folder.

4.) Open Unity editor and select "Open Project".

5.) Navigate to the local folder where you extracted the game files, Go to Assets->Scenes, and select the main Unity project file (ends with .unity).

6.) Wait for Unity to import all the assets and scenes.

7.) Once the import is complete, you can click on the "Play" button in the Unity editor to run the game.


Note: Make sure you have Unity installed on your system before following these steps. Also, keep in mind that you may need to configure some settings, such as the 9.) graphics quality or resolution, before playing the game.
